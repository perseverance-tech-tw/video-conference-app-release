## Welcome to Moil Meeting

**Moil Meeting** provides a state-of-the-art video conferencing experience by transforming a single fisheye camera into a comprehensive meeting system.

This system is engineered as a robust, cost-effective alternative to complex multi-camera arrays, offering intelligent room coverage and motion tracking in a streamlined application.
