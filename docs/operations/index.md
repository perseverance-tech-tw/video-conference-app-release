This feature is designed to help you focus more easily on a specific object by allowing customized transformation adjustments as needed. When you activate the transform, the original appearance of the object (before any transformation) will appear in the corner as a reference, allowing you to compare the changes with the original version. If you wish to revert to the initial state, simply press the Reset button to discard all adjustments and restore the object to its original form. 

## Original Settings

### Field Of View (FOV) Setting

<img
  src="../assets/images/operations/fov_original.png"
  alt="Field Of View Setting"
  style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"
/>
*Field Of View (FOV) Setting*

The Field of View (FOV) Setting in Moil Meet is a critical calibration tool that allows users to define and visualize the specific capture zones of the fisheye lens. Located within the camera configuration panel, this feature enables precise management of the optical coverage to ensure that all participants and meeting areas are properly accounted for in the processed views.

In Moil Meet, the Field of View (FOV) Settings provide a clear, color-coded overlay on the Original Image to help users understand exactly what the lens is seeing. The system supports three distinct FOV presets—**FOV 1 (Red)**, **FOV 2 (Green)**, and **FOV 3 (Blue)**—each of which can be customized to a specific degree, such as 120°, 180°, or 240°. By toggling these settings, users can see concentric dashed circles on the raw fisheye feed, which serve as a guide for framing and dewarping.

### Crosshair

<img
  src="../assets/images/operations/crosshair_original.png"
  alt="Crosshair View"
  style="width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;"
/>
*Crosshair View*

The Crosshair is a toggleable visual guide that, when activated by checking the "Show Crosshair" box, projects a prominent red horizontal axis (X) and a green vertical axis (Y) directly over the Original Image. At the exact intersection of these axes lies a blue focal point, which represents the mathematical center of the lens.
